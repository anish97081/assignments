        "\n",
        "**1. I/O-Bound Tasks:**\n",
        "\n",
        "When tasks involve significant I/O operations (like file reading/writing, network requests, or database queries), multithreading can be beneficial. Threads can efficiently wait for I/O operations to complete without blocking the entire program, allowing other threads to run during this time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Shared Memory Access:**\n",
        "\n",
        "If the tasks need to frequently share data or state, multithreading allows easier communication and data sharing since threads within the same process share memory space. This reduces the overhead of inter-process communication.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Low Overhead:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Creating and managing threads typically has lower overhead compared to processes. For lightweight tasks, the performance cost of switching contexts between threads is usually less than that of processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Real-Time Processing:**\n",
        "\n",
        "In scenarios requiring real-time performance (like certain game engines), threads can be prioritized, allowing for more predictable execution.\n",

        "**1. CPU-Bound Tasks:**\n",
        "\n",
        "For tasks that require intense CPU computations (like numerical calculations, data processing, etc.), multiprocessing can be more efficient. Each process can run on a separate CPU core, taking full advantage of multi-core systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Isolation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiprocessing provides better isolation. Crashes or memory leaks in one process do not affect others, which is critical for applications that require high reliability.\n",

        "\n",
        "In languages like Python, the GIL can hinder performance in multi-threaded CPU-bound programs. Multiprocessing circumvents this limitation by utilizing separate memory spaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Resource Limits:**\n",
        "\n",
        "If the tasks are resource-intensive and could exceed the memory or CPU limits of a single process, multiprocessing can manage resources more effectively by distributing the workload across multiple processes.\n",
